# Binary Classification with Logistic Regression
Logistic regression uses a model to predict the probability for a specific event to happen. So it is 
capable to classify data into a so-called positive and negative group. To make a predictions the 
algorithm needs a training set to build a model based on a logistic function. This implementation of 
a simple logistic regression algorithm can separate data with a descision boundary that consits of a 
linear combination of the features. To learn more complex descision boundaries the algorithm needs a 
regularisation, that will be added soon.

## Datasets
The given dataset is a simple example with two input features. The dataset contains the results of two 
tests of several students as features and a classification whether the student is accepted to a 
university or not. So the task for our logistic regression model is to predict if a student gets 
accepted based on the results of the two tests.

The following figure show the plotted data with the descision boundary for being accepted or not.
